# MYR - Mix Your Reality
MYR is an online editor for editing and viewing virtual worlds and effects. The system provides a beginner friendly interface with robust capabilities and is meant for exploration into the fun of programming.  

MYR uses [Aframe](https://aframe.io), a fantastic open source project, to render objects and effects in the three dimensional space. It is our hope to build on their amazing work.
